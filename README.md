# Women Safety App

## Overview
The Women Safety App is designed to enhance personal security by leveraging machine learning to analyze emotions from voice recordings. When a user speaks, the app detects distress or fear using a trained emotion recognition model. Based on the detected emotion, the app automatically sends an emergency alert message to a predefined emergency contact number.

## Features
- **Real-time Voice Analysis**: Listens to the user's voice and determines their emotional state.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses a trained emotion detection model to recognize distress signals.
- **Emergency Alert System**: Automatically sends alerts when a distressing emotion is detected.
- **Mobile Application**: Provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
- **Backend API**: Flask-based API to handle emotion detection requests.
